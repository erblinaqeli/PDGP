# PDGP
General examinations in the processes of studies and the journey of obtaining knowledge are inevitable.
So having an exam and the right format is to prove and real truth of the students.
Until now, the traditional method of creating exams has been manual. Lots of opportunities for mistakes, 
repetition of questions across different deadlines and very chaotic and stressful for professors. 
In this process, the professors open the Word program and compile the exam. But this can be flawed due to errors, 
repetitions and others that can arise from this manual process. In this project  "Digital Platform for the Generation of Exams (PDGP)" which is fast,
simple, random and facilitates the work of professors for starting exams. In PDGP, professors can perform all the processes of creating exams digitally 
easily and without errors.
